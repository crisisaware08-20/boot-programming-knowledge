Kernel-based Virtual Machine


Under KVM, the Linux kernel itself serves as the hypervisor(monitoring virtual machines)
Memory management and scheduling are handled through the host's kernel, and guest machines are normal Linux processes


    Benifits
    ========

    1) Complexity introduced by multicore cpus are handled by kernel, and no hypervisor change
    2) Linux commands such as ps, top, kill show and control virtual machines



KVM installation and usage
--------------------------

virt-install, to create new KVM guests
virsh, to manage the KVM guests
libvirt, as dependency



The host must be cofigured to support networking in the guests
