A Hindleyâ€“Milner (HM) type system is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.

The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by
defining INTERFACES between different parts of a computer program, and then CHECKING that the parts
have been CONNECTED IN A CONSISTENT WAY                                     


                    Checking

                       |
                       +------|>  Static(at compile time)
                       |
                       |
                       +------|> Dynamicaly(at run time)
                       |
                       |
                       +------|> As combination of both

Type systems has other purposes such as
  a) expressing business rules
  b) enabling compiler optimization
  c) allowing for multiple dispatch
  e) providing a form of documentation
  d) etc


Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.
