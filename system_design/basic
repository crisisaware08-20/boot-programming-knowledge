[] Clarifying system requirements and optmizing possible tradeoffs
[] Drafting your system's API specification 
[] Designing the data models on your system
[] Discussing concerns like logging, monitoring, and alerting or search 
[] Reflecting on your interview experience and evaluating the company



Principle must to follow during 1 hours system design interview.
----------------------------------------------------------------


1. Clarifying functional and non-functional requirements(chapter 3) such as QPS and P99 latency.
Ask if the interviewer wants to start the discussion from a simple system and then scale up design
more features or start with immediately desining a scalable system.

2. Everything is a tradeoff.
Any new addition to the system to improve scalability, consistency,
or latency also increases complexity and cost and requires security, logging, monitoring, and alerting.

3. Drive the interview. Keep interview's interest strong. Discuss what they want. Keep suggesting topic of discussions to them.

4. Be mindful of time. There is too much to discuss in 1 hour

5. Discuss logging, monitoring, alerting, and auditing

6. Discusss testing and maintainability including debuggability, complexity, security, and privacy.

7. Consider and discuss graceful degradation of failure in the overall system and every component, including silent and disguised failures.
Errors can be silent. Never trust anything. Don't trust external or internal systems. Don't trust your own system.

8. Draw system diagrams, flowcharts, and sequence diagrams. Use them as visual aids for your discussions.

9. The system can always be improved. There is always more to discuss.
