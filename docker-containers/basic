Protocols, interfaces, and ports
=================================


port - a process can listen to and handle requests

port - an identifier element of a service or process




Network Layers
==============


Application layer
  This layer contains the "language" that applications and servers use to communicate
  HTTP, TLS(encryption protocol)

  Application layer protocols can often be combined
  HTTP + TLS  = HTTPS

  Application layer processing occures in user space

Transport layer
  Defines the data transmission characteristics of the application layer

  This layer includes data integrity checking, source and destination ports and the
  specifications of breaking application data into packets at the host side

  TCP and UDP

  In Linux, the transport layer and all layers below are primarily handled by the kernel,
  but there are some exceptions whre packets are sent into user space for processing

Network or internet layer
  Defines how to move packets from a source host to a destination host

  Because network layers are meant to be hardware independent, you can simultaneously configure
  several  independent network layers such as IPv4 IPv6 IPX AppleTalk on a single host

Physical layer
  Defines how to send raw data across a physical medium such as Ethernet or a modem
