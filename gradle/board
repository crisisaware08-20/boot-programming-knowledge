Gradle Philosophy
-----------------


It starts with the way JVM is running/executing a program i.e class or a jar file. Also think of the --classpath option.

Think of a world where you would only have the following tools
javac - for compiling the files
java - for execution of jvm programs


how would you compile multiple files ?
how would you group your files conceptually and why ?
by running few scenarios through your mind can you spot the pain points, what are they ?
