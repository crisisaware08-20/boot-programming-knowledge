                                   When there is no link between "Bound" and "Binding Occurence" then it's a free variable
                                   When the bound process happens ?
                                   A free variable that has been bound with a Closure: upvalues


                                +---------------------+          +-----------------------------------------+
                                | Bound(the variable) |          | Binding Occurrence(variable declaration)|

                                                    Static Binding
                                         (a.k.a static scoping or lexical binding)
         oop languages: dynamic binding is used at runtime based on object, while static binding at compile based on reference type





                              languages with support for higher order functions with free variables


                                    closure - a value
                                    when is it evaluated ?
