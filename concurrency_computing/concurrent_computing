                                                     =====================
                                      IS A FORM OF COMPUTING IN WHICH SEVERAL COMPUTATIONS ARE EXECUTED
                      CONCURRENTLY - DURING OVERLAPPING TIME - INSTEAD OF SEQUENTIALLY, WITH ONE COMPLETING BEFORE THE NEXT STARTS.



                                      THIS IS A PROPERTY OF THE SYSTEM - WHETHER A PROGRAM, COMPUTER, 
                      OR A NETWORK - WHERE THERE IS A SEPARATE EXECUTION POINT OR THREAD OF CONTROL FOR EACH PROCESS 




Models for understanding and analyzing concurrent computing systems include
========

      - Actor Model
      - Petri Nets
      - Process calculi
            - Comunicating sequential processes(CSP)


Interaction and communication
========

        In some concurrent computing systems, communication between the concurrent components is hidden from the progrmmer(by using features) while
        in others it must be hadled explicitly. Explicit communication can be devided into two classes


        Shared memory communication
        Message passing communication
