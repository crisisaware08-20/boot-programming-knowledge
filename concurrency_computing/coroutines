Coroutine are computer program components that generalize subroutines for non-preemtive multitasking

Relationship between coroutines isn't that of caller-calle, but instead symetric

Well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as
    cooperative tasks, exception, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes
