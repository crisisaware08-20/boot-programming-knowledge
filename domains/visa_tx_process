Transactions goes through three general processes

								1.Authorization
								2.Clearing
								3.Settlement



The result of Authorization is funds blocking on customer's card for up to 7 days for debit cards and 28 days for credit cards
This gives time to make sure that the customer's card is valid and that the customer is not a fraud. This operation is free of charge and can be canceled at any time for free. It's impossible to create a chargeback for this operation, since there was neither the 
   - Clearing fact
			- nor the Settlement fact


	After Clearing, all transactions have already been successfully registered for all participants in the process, but no funds transfer flow has been made yet. This usually happens in 1-2 banking days. Once the Clearing is done, a dispute flow can be initiated.
