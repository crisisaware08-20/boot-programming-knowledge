Takeways

 - Delegation of work through supervised workers allows for higher levels of concurrency and fault tolerance.
 - Workers are asynchrounous and run concurrently, neverr sitting idle as in synchronous systems.
 - Efficient utilization of system resources (CPU, memory, and threads) results in reduced infrastructure costs.
 - It's simple to scale elastically at the actor level by increasing or decreasing workes as needed.
 - Using clusters gives the ability to scale at the system level.
