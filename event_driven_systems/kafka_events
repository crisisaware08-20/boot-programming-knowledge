Some kind of structure to the data,    application <------> kafka

																			serialization/deserialization

The serailzed object usually is a representation of a domain application object. The structure is very important


Key - can be complex type, usually a primitive. A key in kafka message is not like a primary key in databse or uuid. 
It's more like an identifier of some entity in the system, like an user, or order.
