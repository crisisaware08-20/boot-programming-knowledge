 Type coercion
--------------

  Type conversion, type coercion, type casting, type juggling are different ways of changing an expression from
  one data type to another.

  Type conversion can take advantage of certain features of type hierarchies


  Two important aspects of type conversion
      1. whether it happens implicitly or explicitly
      2. and whether the underlying data representation is converted from one representation
          into another, or a given representation is merely reinterpreted as the represenation of another data type
