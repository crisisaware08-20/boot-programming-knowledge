Parallel Programming Languages
==============================

These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory 
     - architectureâ€”shared memory, 
     - distributed memory, 
     - or shared distributed memory

Concurrent programming languages, libraries, APIs, and parallel programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) have been created for programming parallel computers
