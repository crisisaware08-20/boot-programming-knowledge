Fake
Stub
  used for providing the tested code with "indirect input"
Spies
Mock
  used for verifying "indirect output" of the tested code, by the first defining the expectation before the tested code is executed


Two concepts that will help
  - indirect outputs ----> Mock
  - indirect inputs ----> Stub



// provide inputs to the tested code
    when(stub.doSomething("hello")).thenReturn(1)
    exersie sut

// verifying indirect output of the tested code
    verify()
    exersise sut


There are two styles of mocking
  - Expectations-first style
  - Record-then-verify style




Expectations-first style
============
 Expectation are set on mock objects before exercising the system under test.


Record-then-verify style
============
( This is the mockito style)
Expectation are verified after the system under test has executed
