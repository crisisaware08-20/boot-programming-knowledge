                                          - Require a data backplane for capturig incoming data
                                          - Require always on, which means resiliency, availability and dynamic scalability

                                                Microservices community has developed techniques for meeting these requirements

                                          - Cause we exploit and extract information more quickly, we need a more integrated environment
                                            between our microservices and stream processors.
