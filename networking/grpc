Remote Procedure Call is a software communication protocol.

RPC - Remote Procedure Call

RPC model implies a level of location transparency.

RPC is a form of IPC

RPC is a request-response protocol


Standard Contact Mechanisms
---------------------------

grpc is using HTTP/2 as transport protocol and Protobuf as serialization

                                              OS sockets


1.Creation
Socket is represented as a file descriptor, which is an integer used to identify an open file or socket within the process.

2. Binding
Socket needs to be bound to a specific address and port on the local machine.

                 Network Interface & Port 

3. Listening
If Server socket --> Listening on the assigned port. In this state sockets waits for incomming connection requests from clients.

4. Connecting
If Client socket -->  initiate a connection to a remote server.The operating system performs the necessary network operations to establish a connection, such as TCP SYN packets in case of TCP/IP connections.


5. Accepting Connection(Server Socket)
When server socket receive a client socket connection request the server socket transitions from listening to state to established state and accept incoming connection request. Upon accepting the a connection, the server socket creates a new "client socket" or "peer socket" to handle communication with the specific client.

6. Data transfer
For stream-oriented sockets(e.g TCP), data is transmitted in a continuous stream and is guaraneed to arrive in the same order it was sent.
For datagram-oriented sockets(e.g UDP), data is transmitted in discrete packets without any guarantee of the order or reliability.

7. Socket Closure


Through this process, the OS kernel manages the state of each socket, handles network I/O operations, and ensure proper data transmission between endpoints.
