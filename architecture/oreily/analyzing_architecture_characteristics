The ship sank because the architect tried to implement ALL the requirements




Architecture tradeoff analysis method(ATAM)
============================================

        Phases

          partnership and preparation: get stakeholders all together, define the roles, discuses the goal, approach, and time frame, logistics
          evaluation phase1: stakeholders giving us the scenarios, they could be functional/operational scenarios. Our goal is to find holes. During this process we start doing the tradeoffs here (high performance and availability)
          evaluation phase2: rework
          followup:

          There are couple of problems, it does assume that all stakeholders are in the same room. Maybe you don't want them to be in the same room :), or they are not available

          The key here is to focus on the Goal of ATAM not necesarily on the process

          The ATAM Goal:
          =============
              Create an architecture presentation
              Validate the architecture and establish trade-offs
              Identify and mitigate risk
              Get stakeholders buy-in, even the developers
