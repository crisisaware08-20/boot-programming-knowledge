Every keybinding lives in a key table . There are three built-in key tables:



prefix
=======

<C-b> - trigger the binding

Keys in this table must be pressed after the prefix <C-b> to trigger the binding

This is the table that the <bind> command uses by default


root
======

Keys in this table can just be pressed, without any prefix

Use -n (a shortcut for -T root) to bind keys int this table.

Example: bind -n C-t new-window
