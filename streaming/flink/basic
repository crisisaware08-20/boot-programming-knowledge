Logical Graph, Data flow

Operator - an operation processing incoming data. map, filter, window, etc
Task - Think of it like a thread

Operator/Task Communication


Keyd Streams(Parallelism and Partitioning)
	A Keyd Stream partition stream by a key, ensuring that all the events with the same key goes to the same Task
	This enables parallelism, as different keys are processed by different tasks on potentially different nodes
	keyBy triggers data shuffling across the network to group all events with the same key to the same task
	Each key becomes a separate sub-stream(logical grouping) processed independentely.

Chained Streams
	Chain operators like map, filter, etc. into a single task, so they execute sequentially within the same thread
	No shuffling, serialization, or network communication between chained operators
	Flink automatically chains compatible operators into the same task unless explicitly disabled using .disableChaining() or .startNewChain().


More on Tasks

Task in Flink represent a unit of execution. It coresponds to a THREAD that executes one or more [CHAINED OPERATORS]
Flink programs consists of [ LOGICAL OPERATORS ] like map, filter, keyBy
At runtime, Flink groups [OPERATORS] into [TASKS] based on the [CHAINING CONFIGURATION]
Each [TASK] is executed by a [TASK SLOT] in a taskmanager(flink worker node)
