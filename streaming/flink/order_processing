Flink provides several mechanisms to maintain order while parallelizing [ TASKS ]

Within each [TASK] Flink processes events sequentially, preserving order for that key

a) Keyed Streams
Example: If your key is tied to a particular user(e.g a stream of banking transactions), you can use keyBy(userId)
to parallelize the stream while maintaining the order for each user.


b) Event Time and Watermarks
Flink uses event time(timestamps embedded in events) and watermarks(indicator of event progress) to manage out of order data
By assining timestamps and setting watermarks appropriate, Flink can reorder events within a bounded delay(e.g a few seconds) 
Example: A stream of log events from multiple servers, where logs are slightly out of order but must be processed sequentially after correction.


c) Serialization of Operators
If parallelization is not possible (e.g strict global ordering is required), you can configure a stream to run with parallelism=1 for certain stages of the job.


d) Chaining Operators
Flink allows [ OPERATORS ] to be chained together in a single task to avoid shuffling data between nodes.

Examples

a) Keyed Streams

DataStream<Event> stream = env.fromSource(source, WatermarkStrategy.nowaterMarks(), "Event Source")
// keyBy ensures that all events with the same key go to the same task and are processed in order
DataStream<Event> keyedStream = stream.keyBy(event -> event.getUserId()).process(new EventProcessor());


c) Single Parallelism

DataStream<Event> stream = env.fromSource(source, WatermarkStrategy.nowaterMarks(), "Event Source")
stream.process(new EventProcessor).setParallelism(1);
