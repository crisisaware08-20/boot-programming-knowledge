Dealing with conflicts in RDBMS


1) Conflict avoidance
    - 2PL, Two-phase locking

2) Conflict detection


Two-phase locking is a pessimistic concurrency control. 


By two-phases protocol, locks are applied and removed in two two-phases
   1. Expanding phase: locks are aquired and no locks are released
   2. Shrinkning phase: locks are released and no locks are aquired
