What is OPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY and why it is used in environments with LOW DATA CONTENTION ?


CONTENTION, is the situation when processes or threads are trying to access the same resource.
In our case the contention is focused on lock resource that is used as a synchronization mechanism

DATA CONTENTION
---------------
In database management systems, block contention (or data contention) refers to multiple processes or instances competing for access to the same index or data block at the same time. In general this can be caused by very frequent index or table scans, or frequent updates.

                                   Optimistic Concurrency Control


                        Much higher concurrency
                        No chance of deadlock
                        In case of conflict, overhead rollback and retry logic


READ_COMMIT Isolation level, preferable
READ_UNCOMMITTED, at this level you can implemente OCC but I guess it will require lot of controlling on application level.


I don't get it how it is implmented into JPA


Note! that transactions does not wait, it will have the attempt and if something wrong then the appropriate exception thrown.
Note! in PCC, deadlock could happen that's why you might want to have timeouts
