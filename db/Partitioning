Issue:     | Long running queries |
           +----------------------+


Tables containing large amounts of data may begin to experience performance issues
with long running queries and data manipulation operations.

                      
                         Table(Data Set)


              +--------+       +---------+       +---------+
              |  ds1   |       |  ds2    |       |  ds3    |
              +--------+       +---------+       +---------+
                  p1               p2                p3


This approach can:
  1) enhance query performance
  2) reduce storage requirements
  3) boost processing by enabling parallel processing


Database partitioning involves spliting a logical database into distinct, independent parts.



                                          Partition Strategies



            +----------------------+                     +-----------------------+
            |vertical partitioning |                     |horizontal partitioning|
            +----------------------+                     +-----------------------+


   - each partition is a subset of the columns            - each partition is a subset of the rows
     from the original table.                             from the original table.
   
   - manage columns that are frequently updated                




Sharding
----------------
A database shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine.
Each shard is hold on separate database server instance, to spread load.

Is a subset of partitioning where different Shards are distributed across distinct machines or nodes. 
This structure offers severals benefits, 
  a) improved scalability
  b) higher availability
  c) enhanced parallel processing, 
  d) and faster query execution.
