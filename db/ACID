ACID
=========

A set of properties of database transaction intended to guaranty
data validity despite errors, power failures, etc.

Atomicity
Consistency
Isolation
Durability


Atomicity
---------
All or nothing


Consistency
---------
  in RDBMS this are the constraints: foreign keys, uniques, etc


Isolation
--------

Can my transactions see changes made by other transactions ?

Read phenomena

Isolation levels


Isolation knob is in the hand of the engineer
As a lack of isolation you get in "Read phenomenas"



Data consistency models: ACID and BASE

What is difference between ACID and BASE consistency ?

	ACID databases prioritize consistency over availability - the whole transaction fails if an 
	error occurs in any step within transaction.

	BASE prioritize availability over consistency, instead of failing the transaction users can 
	access incosistent data temporarly.


	Consistency means all clients see the same data at the same time


	ACID transactions are far more pessimistic, they are worried about the data safety
