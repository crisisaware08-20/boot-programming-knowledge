[v] What is the domain of transaction isolation levels
    Answer: an evironment with concurrent transactions.

[v] What is concurrency control implementation used for each of transaction level isolation ?
   A pessimistic concurrency control method like Two-phase locking(2PL) that guaratees conflict-serializability.
	 The Protocol uses locks, applied by a transaction to data, which may block other transactions from accessing the same data during the transaction's life.

Transaction isolation levels control the following effects:
	- Wheather locks are taken when data is read, and what type of locks are requested.
	- How long the read locks are held.
	- Wheather read operations referencing rows modified by another transaction:
		- Block until the exclusive lock on the row is freed.
		- Retrieve the commited version of the row that existed at the time the statement or transaction started.
		- Read the uncommitted data modification




| Isolation Level  | Locking strategy                                                                                 |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read Uncommitted | Read: No Lock acquired                                                                           |
|                  | Write: No Lock acquired                                                                          |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read committed   | Read: Shared lock acquired and released as soon as read is done                                  |
|                  | Write: Exclusive lock acquired and keep till end of transaction                                  |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repeatable read  | Read: Shared lock acquired and released only at the end of the transaction                       |
|                  | Write: Exclusive lock acquired and released only at the end of the transaction                   |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Serializable     | same as "Repeatable read" + apply Range lock and lock is only released at the end of transaction |

Read commited - Each Query in a Transaction only sees commited stuff

Repeatable read - Each Query in a transaction only sees committed updates at the beggining of transaction
