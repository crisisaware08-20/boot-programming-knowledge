We have a lost update. Any attempts to make this schedule serial would give off two different
results(either T1's version of A and B is shown, or T2's version of A and B is shown). This 
schedule would not be serializable!!!

Strict 2PL overcomes this incosistency by locking T1 out from B. Unfortunately, deadlocks
are something Strcit 2PL does not overcome all the time.
