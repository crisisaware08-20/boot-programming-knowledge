Two-phase locking is a pessimistic concurrency control method that guarantees
conflict-serializability.


By 2PL protocol, locks are applied and removed in two two-phases
   1. Expanding phase: locks are aquired and no locks are released
   2. Shrinkning phase: locks are released and no locks are aquired

Two types of locks are used by the basic protocol: Shared and Exclusive locks.


Rules of read(shared) and write(exclusive) lock
-----------------------------

1) A transaction is allowed to read an object if and only if it is holding a read-lock or write-lock
on that object

2) A transaction is allowd to write an object if and only if it is holding a write-lock on that object.

3) A schedule(set of transactions) is allowed to hold multiple locks on the same object 
simultaneously if and only if none of those locks are write-locks.


Variants
----------
guarantees: 
	conflict serializability(2PL, C2PL, S2PL, SS2PL)
	view serializability
	recoverability
	strictness

prevents:
	phantom reads
	dirty reads

eliminates:
	deadlocks (C2PL)

C2PL Conservative two phase locking - C2PL's transactions obtain all the locks they need before the transactions begin.
