In computing, a processor, or processing unit is a digita circuit which performs operations on some external data source, usually memory or some other
data stream


Processor are something general that could be applied in different areas, that's why there are multiple processors type by their applience


CPUs
 - If designed conforming to the von Neuman architecture, it contains at least a control unit, arithimetic logic unit and processor register
GPU
VPU
TPU
NPU
DPU
ISP


What are the abstractions used over all this processors ?
Can we use C/C++ language to programme on top of a GPU or TPU or NPU ?
