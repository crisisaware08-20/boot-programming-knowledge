run levels
  1 - only the basic processes are started with one console terminal
  3 - init, network, ect
  5 - level where the system starts the graphical X Window software, and allows to login with gui

device drivers are compiled to in the kernel either added as modules to the kernel

  1. Character, are for devices that can only handle on character at a time
  2. Block, such as disk devices
  3. Network, used for devices that use packets to send and receive data

    network programming protocols

kernel supports multiple filesystems


The GNU organization developed a complete set of Unix utilities, but had no kernel system to them on
This utilities were developed under a software philosophy called open source software

Uniting Linus's Linux kernel with the GNU operating system utilities created complete, functional, free operating system


GNU coreutils package
  - utilities to handle files
  - utilities for manipulating text
  - utilitie for managing processes


Shell - the interactive utility. Core of this utility is the command prompt(the interactive part of the shell)


linux desktop environment

1)
video card in the pc and the monitor: The X Window Software. Controls how Linux applications present fancy windows and graphics
Other operating systems can use it. In linux world several implementations of X Window System such as X.org

Wayland - Fedora
Mir - Ubuntu

2)
A desktop environment on top of X Window System


Shells, how do you get to the shells ?


Console Terminals - take linux system out of the ui and will get the Linux Console mode
Graphical Terminals - simulates working on a console terminal but within a desktop graphical window 

virtual console terminals - as CLI terminals outside the GUI
graphical terminal emulators - as CLI terminals in the GUI
