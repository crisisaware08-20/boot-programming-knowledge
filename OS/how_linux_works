Kernel is in charge of managing tasks in four general system areas:
Processes
  the kernel is responsible for determining which processes are followed to use cpu
Memory
  the kernel needs to keep track of all memory - what is currently allocated to a particular process, what might be shared between processes.
Device drivers
  the kernel acts as an interface between hardware and processes.
System calls and support
  processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel
