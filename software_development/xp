XP - software development methodology
  - adovcate releases in short development cycles
  - programming in pairs
  - doing extensive code review
  - unit testing of all code
  - a flat management structure
  - expecting changes in customer's requirements
  - frequent communication with customers and among programmers

  The methodology take best practices to extream levels
